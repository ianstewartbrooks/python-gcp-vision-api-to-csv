# Google Vision Image Analysis results to CSV

This application 'walks' all the images in a in the subfolders and passes them through the Google Cloud Vision API for analysis. The results from GCP Vision API are stored in a CSV file.

I initially wrote this code when I was learning how to use the API's available as part of the Google Cloud Platform.

Note: I no longer have access to the Google Cloud Platform account so I am unable to check to make sure this code is 100% working.
