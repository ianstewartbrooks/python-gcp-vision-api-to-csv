# Google Vision Image Analysis results to CSV

This application 'walks' all the images in a in the subfolders and passes them through the Google Cloud Vision API for analysis. The results from GCP Vision API are stored in a CSV file.

I wrote this code for a task I was working on with my employer.

Note: I no longer have access to the Google Cloud Platform account so I am unable to check to make sure this code is 100% working.
